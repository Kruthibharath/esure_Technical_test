# esure_Technical_test

Thanks for providing me the opportunity to do the test.

while coding both the parts,
I was unable to get the exact font-family to use. I have used a closely resembling font. 

**Part 2:**

I have edited the HTML content and added few styles at the end of esure-About you.html file.

These are the steps to be followed to see the results:
1.  Follow the link https://www.esure.com/ and then select ‘Get a quote’ for the Home product. 
2.  Right Click and select 'Save as' option to save the HTML file to local system and then open the file in the editor.
3.  Replace the entire content with the content of esure-About you.html file.
    
    
    Please contact me on kruthi.bharath@gmail.com or on 07848389020 if you need any further info on the code.
